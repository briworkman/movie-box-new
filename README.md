# Movie Box 2.0

[Movie Box 2.0](https://movie-box-2.netlify.app/) is a new and improved version of an app I had built in the past. It is an application that allows you to view and search your favorite movie plots, budgets, actors, and more. The front end was built with React and Redux, and used the [Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=en-US).
